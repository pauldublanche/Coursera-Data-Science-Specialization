# Coursera Specialization Data Science: Foundations using R

I created this repository to group and present my work on the 10 courses of the [Specialization Data Science Program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science#about):
- **Data Scientist Toolbox**
- **R Programming**
- Getting and cleaning data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Reproducible research
- Statistical inference
- Regression models
- Practical machine learning
- Developing data products
- Data science capstone

As I'm currently taking these lectures and updating my github at the same time so this repository will be complete as soon as i've been through all of them.

I welcome any comment or advice you may have that will help me improve this repository.
